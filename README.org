
* csharp-mode

This is a mode for editing C# in emacs. It's based on cc-mode, v5.30.3 and above.

** Main features;

- font-lock and indent of C# syntax including:
  - all c# keywords and major syntax
  - attributes that decorate methods, classes, fields, properties
  - enum types
  - #if/#endif #region/#endregion
  - instance initializers
  - anonymous functions and methods
  - verbatim literal strings (those that begin with @)
  - generics 
- automagic code-doc generation when you type three slashes.
- intelligent insertion of matched pairs of curly braces.
- sets the compiler regex for next-error, for csc.exe output.
- flymake integration, if you use it
- integration with ya-snippet.el, if you have it.
- imenu indexing of C# source, for easy menu-based navigation. 

** Usage

Currently this repo is not published to ELPA/MELPA/Marmelade, so you need to clone it.

Once added to your .emacs.d it should be loadable using

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (require 'csharp-mode)
#+END_SRC

* Attribution

This repo is a fork of the code originally developed by Dylan R. E. Moonfire and
further maintained by Dino Chiesa as hosted on [[https://code.google.com/p/csharpmode/][Google code]].

** Change of focus

The original csharp-mode repo contained lots of different code for lots of different purposes,
some finished, some not, some experimental, some not. Basiaclly things like ASPX-mode, TFS-mode,
code completion backends, etc.

This repo intends to refocus on the major-mode and the csharp-mode package.
This means that tasks like code-completion will be left out to better suited projects
like [[https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-emacs][Omnisharp-Emacs]].

That means lots of old code will be cleaned out, but the original contents can still be found in
the [[https://github.com/josteink/csharp-mode/tree/extras][extras-branch]].
